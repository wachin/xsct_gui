## 🌙  xsct_gui – Easy Screen Light Control, for X11 Window Manager

This program helps you **adjust the color and brightness of your screen** on Linux, making it more comfortable to look at — especially at night.

It’s like adding a “warm light filter” (similar to your phone’s night mode that diminishes the blue light) to reduce eye strain and make late-night screen time easier on your eyes.

`xsct_gui` is a **graphical interface** for [xsct](https://github.com/faf0/sct), a small command-line tool that changes your screen’s color temperature using `xrandr`.

---

## 🎯 What does this program do?

- 🔆 **Adjusts screen color**: Make your screen more orange (warm) or more white (cool).
- 💡 **Controls brightness**: Make the screen dimmer or brighter.
- 🖱️ All through a **simple, easy-to-use interface** with sliders.

✅ Perfect for nighttime use, studying, or working on your computer.  
💡 Try to match your screen color to the lighting in your room — and avoid blue-heavy lights at night!

## 💻 The Operating System you need

You’ll need a Linux system using the **X11 Window Manager** (not Wayland).  
As of 2025, these desktop environments still support X11 sessions:

- GNOME
- KDE
- Linux Mint
- XFCE
- LXQt
- LXDE
- openbox, fluxbox, jwm, and other X11 window managers

> ❗ This tool **won’t work on Wayland**. Make sure you log in using an X11 session.

### ✅ Required software

Before using `xsct_gui`, make sure you have these installed (open a terminal and run):

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-tk xsct python3-pil.imagetk python3-cairosvg
```

The following is a table with the description of each one

|              Program               |                          Purpose                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python 3**                       | The programming language the GUI is written in.           |
| **Tkinter** (`python3-tk`)         | Creates the window and buttons (GUI toolkit).             |
| **Pillow** (`python3-pil.imagetk`) | Displays the colorful gradient bars.                      |
| **CairoSVG** (`python3-cairosvg`)  | Allows the program to show SVG icons (like the app icon). |
| **xsct**                           | The actual tool that changes your screen color.           |
| **Papirus Icon Theme**             | Provides a nice app icon.                                 |

> 📝 If you're using **Debian 11 (bullseye)** or **Debian 10 (buster)**, `xsct` isn't available. You'll need to compile it manually (see instructions at the end).

## ▶️ How to use the program
First, you need to have the program in a folder on your Linux computer

### **1st OPTION: Download the repository**
Go to the website:

[https://github.com/wachin/xsct_gui](https://github.com/wachin/xsct_gui)

click on the arrow-like dropdown in Code:

**<>  Code ▼**

and click on:

**Download ZIP**

extract it, and inside the folder you'll find the `Launcher.sh` file
or you can clone it:

### **2nd OPTION: Clone the repository**

**1.-** Since we already have git installed, open a terminal in a folder where you have Linux programs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wachin/xsct_gui  
```

and enter there with:

```bash
cd xsct_gui  
```

## Run the Launcher.sh file

Make sure the `Launcher.sh` script is executable. In the file manager, right-click on it and in the "**Permissions**" tab make sure it "**is executable**"
Double-click the `Launcher.sh` script and click `Run`

👉 A window will open with two controls:

# Clone and compile xsct
git clone https://github.com/faf0/sct
cd sct
make
sudo make install
```

Then install the GUI dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-tk python3-pil.imagetk python3-cairosvg
```

Now run:
```bash
python3 xsct_gui.py
```
